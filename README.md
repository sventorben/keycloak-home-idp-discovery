## What is it good for?

When a federated user wants to login via Keycloak, Keycloak will present a username/password form and a list of configured identity providers to the user. The user needs to choose an identity provider to get redirected.
This authenticator allows to skip the step of selecting an identity provider.

## How does it work?

If this authenticator gets configured as part of a browser based login flow, Keycloak will present a username form (without password form and without list of configured identity providers).
A user can then enter an email address. Keycloak will then choose an identity provider based on the domain part of the provided email address and forward the user to the chosen provider.
